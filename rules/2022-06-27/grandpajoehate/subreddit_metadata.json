Fuck that guy. He's a piece of shit.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n\n\"What rules? We didn't see any rules, did we, Charlie?\"\n\nFuck you Grandpa Joe, there are rules: \n\n* No politics\n* No Spam\n* Linking to other posts should use np.reddit\n* Don't steal fizzy lifting drink \n* Don't sell secrets to Sluggsworth\n* Recent reposts may be removed\n* Pro-Grandpa Joe may be removed ^((see additional guidelines for exceptions)^) \n\n**Additional Guidelines**\n\n* Grandpa Joe spoofing is ok if it shows Grandpa Joe's true horrible self. Examples of appropriate spoofs: [1](https://i.redd.it/qggemgjardy21.png), [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/grandpajoehate/comments/bpwoww/hey_reddit_im_grandpa_joe_ama/),[3](https://old.reddit.com/r/grandpajoehate/comments/ajsmfy/how_does_this_crook_sleep_at_night/efukuh3/),[4](https://old.reddit.com/r/grandpajoehate/comments/a1n83n/how_to_act_bedridden_and_make_family_do_work_for/)\n* Remember we are attacking the character Grandpa Joe. Just like we wouldn't attack actors who portray Hitler, we wouldn't attack the actor who portrayed Grandpa Joe. If you post a picture of Jack Albertson (or David Kelly) from a different movie the post still must still be referring to Grandpa Joe. Examples of ok posts: [1](https://old.reddit.com/r/grandpajoehate/comments/bfpqqh/was_watching_the_twilight_zone_and_saw_a_familiar/),
