Be civil and respect your fellow redditors\n\n>>- Harassment, any kind of hate speech, personal attacks and insults, verbal abuse etc. are strictly forbidden. \n\n>>- Comment trees which devolve into arguments are likely to be entirely removed.\n\n>>- Do not feed the trolls. Report and ignore.\n\n>---\n\n>>##2\\. [Read the FAQ](/r/Naruto/wiki/faq)\n\n>>* Any question answered in the FAQ will be removed. \n>>* It covers the Naruto/Boruto manga, anime, light novels, and more.\n\n>---\n\n>>##3\\. Flair & title your post properly\n\n>>* Title your post so that someone can tell what it is about before opening it.\n\n>>* No one-worded, hashtags, only emojis, or clickbait/misleading titles.\n\n>>* Do not beg for follows/likes/upvotes\n\n>>* Account usernames in the titles should be included in brackets at the end of the title\n\n>>* You must add [**link flair**](/r/Naruto/wiki/linkflair) to your post.\n\n>>* [**Click here**](/r/naruto/wiki/mobilelinkflair) for how to flair on mobile.\n\n>>* The moderators will flair the post themselves after a period of time has passed (~30 minutes) with it being left without a flair. Multiple instances of not flairing posts will be kept track of and result in a violation of the rule. \n\n>---\n\n>>##4\\. Tag Spoilers\n\n>>* Absolutely no spoilers in titles!  \n>>* Spoiler tag anything beyond the Boruto anime, such as episode previews, schedules, and the Boruto manga. Spoiler rules **do not** apply for the Naruto series. \n>>* Comments in threads that are already spoiler-marked do not need to be hidden in spoiler tags.\n>>* Use common courtesy and spoiler tag major events when referring to spoilers of other series, not necessarily limited to just manga/anime either.\n\n\n>---\n\n>>##5\\. Limit low-effort submissions\n\n>> - Absolutely no memes, image macros, or shitposts are allowed. Use /r/dankruto. Any low-effort posts which do not even belong in dankruto shouldn't be posted at all.\n>>- Limit plain screenshots/gifs/caps of the manga/anime.\n>>- Posts should be directly related to Naruto.\n\n>---\n\n>>##6\\. All Fanart, Fanedits, & Cosplays must be linked directly to the artist's page\n\n>>- Quick sketches and works in progress are not allowed. Only thorough and complete works can be posted. However, one post can be made if you genuinely want to receive feedback.\n>>- Incorrectly sourced work will be removed. To link directly to the source, **copy-paste the url of the work into the url space that's available when making a link post.** Uploading said work as an image and leaving the link in the comment thread is the incorrect method. \n>>- If the art/edit/cosplay in question is original content (OC) re-hosting on Reddit/Imgur/etc is fine.\n>>- Use image searching tools to find the original artist: [Saucenao](http://saucenao.com) or [Google Images.](https://images.google.com/)\n>>- Limit yourself to one fanart submission within approximately 24 hours.\n>>- Do not post art from the same user multiple days in a row. \n\n>---\n\n>>##7\\. Be mindful of our self-promotion policy\n\n>>- Self-promotion should be thoughtful, limited, and consistently well received by the community. \n>>- The 9:1 ratio (ie. every one promotional post should be followed by approximately nine quality discussion threads) should be followed.\n\n>---\n\n>>##8\\. VS. Battle & Crossover posts\n\n>>- Simply posting a matchup in the title will not suffice, as not much effort is needed to do so. Give an explanation in the text box or comments; talk about why you chose the matchup, the conditions, who you think will win, etc.\n>>- Crossover battle posts with other series are not allowed. Power scaling across different series can be so different and difficult to compare that discussion gets messy. r/whowouldwin would be the better outlet for these posts. \n\n>---\n\n>>##9\\. Support the creators and rights holders!\n\n>>- /r/Naruto does not endorse any sort of third party that is profiting off of copyright infringement. Avoid linking to illegal third-party sites and encourage other users to search for legal alternatives for finding Naruto and Boruto content.\n\n>>- /r/Naruto is not a platform for selling/buying/promoting unlicensed merchandise and any links or mentions of said material will be removed unless they are being sold under a creative license.\n\n>>- Read Naruto and Boruto from [MangaPlus and Viz](https://www.reddit.com/r/Naruto/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_read_the_manga.3F)\n\n>---\n\n>>##10\\. No NSFW Content\n\n>>* This includes obvious fetish posts, sexually suggestive or provocative cosplays, actual nudity or hentai and so on. If you feel your post is a bit tame and doesn't violate this rule, you can post it but flair it as NSFW. Anything explicit however, use /r/cosplaygirls or some other NSFW subreddit.\n\n>---\n\n>>##11\\. No Reposts\n\n>>- Do not repost anything from the top 100 all-time or anything posted within the last 3 months.\n\n>>- Anything which has been posted before at least 5 times cannot be reposted\n\n>>- Use the search bar, your search engine, and the FAQ to ensure that you are not reposting recent content or already answered questions.\n\n>>- Boruto episode previews and schedules should be posted once per month, and only if accompanied with a translation. Untranslated schedules/previews will be removed.\n\n>---\n\n>>##12\\. No Naruto video game spam \n\n>>- Only news or official information related to the video game(s) are allowed. Everything else goes to /r/NarutoNinjaStorm, /r/NarutoShinobiStriker, and other Naruto video game subreddits. \n>>-Exceptions can be made for video games without a designated subreddit.\n\n>---\n\n>>##13\\. No low-effort polls\n\n\n\n>>- Polls should\n\n>>- be comprehensive\n>>- not be spammed.\n>>- avoid bashing characters and others\n>>- follow vs battle rules if necessary\n>>- No meme/joke polls with some exception.\n\n---\n\n>#Spoilers\n\n>**Do not add any spoilers in the title of your post.**\n\n> Anything **after** the current Boruto anime is considered spoilers (Boruto manga, future episode previews/summaries). \n\n>Spoiler rules **do not** apply to the Naruto series (anime and manga).
