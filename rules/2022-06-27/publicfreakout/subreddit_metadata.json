Drugged out or sober, anything goes. Keep the comments respectful where mental disorders are concerned, and remember that the individuals depicted in these videos are real people too. This subreddit is essentially dedicated to their worst moments, so do keep that in mind.\n\nSaturated with TV and movies, our brains have become used to watching the imitation of emotions, so much so that it is strangely surprising and fascinating to watch the real thing.\n\n[Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/4ou9dl/a_man_wastes_several_days_trying_to_prove_to/d4fljyw)\n\n##Rules:\n\n1. Never post personal information, do not ask for personal information, do not encourage, call for, or participate in witch-hunts or targeted harassment campaigns\n\n2. Comment with tact in videos which may involve mental disorders\n\n3. Abusive comments will be removed at moderator discretion and may result in a temporary or permaban\n\n4.  Bans: Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry,  etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)\n\n5. Video Posts only [exception: Gifs uploaded to reddit or imgur and follow-up news reports]\n\n6. Text Posts (and images of text) may only be posted after moderator approval. Message the mods via modmail before making a post of that nature.\n\n7. Reposts over 4 weeks old are permitted.  Reposts under 4 weeks old will be removed.\n\n8. This isn't /r/watchpeopledie: People being straight up murdered or dying in shocking/gruesome ways should be the cut-off  (exceptions for newsworthy events covered in publications of good repute).\n\n9. Facebook Videos are allowed, but not encouraged. If you must post a video hosted on Facebook, you need to provide a link to a copy of the video hosted on a more acceptable video hosting platform. For videos under 10 minutes [Streamable](https://streamable.com/clipper) makes it easy to make copies of videos.\n\n10. Don't mess with /u/Ezziboo or Mobility Mary.\n\n11. Submissions must fit the purpose of the community. /r/PublicFreakout is a subreddit dedicated to people freaking out, melting down, losing their cool, or being weird in public.\n\n[When you get banned for violating the rules, it has nothing to do with free speech but we do welcome appeals of all moderator decisions via modmail.\n](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/free_speech.png)\n\n##Tags:\n\n**[Mod's Choice]** - The mark of a good find and a quality freakout\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:Top**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=top&t=all)\n\n* [**Sort by Mod's Choice:New**](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/search?q=flair%3A%22Mod%27s+Choice%22&sort=new&restrict_sr=on&t=all)\n\nUsers who submit a \"Mod's Choice\" qualify for permanent custom user flair.
