[Check out our giveaway calendar!](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/6?cid=Z2FkZ2V0c21vZHNAZ21haWwuY29t)\n\n\n\n\n### Please read the rules:\n\n1. Submissions must be explicitly about a single gadget. (Posts about software or tech companies will be removed. Gadget concepts which do not actually exist belong in /r/ImaginaryGadgets).\n\n2. Self promotion is not allowed in /r/gadgets. Do not submit links to sites that you are affiliated with. Native advertising and \"advertorials\" are also not allowed.\n\n3. Submissions about pre-release or pre-order products are subject to these rules/conditions: \n   - The article must be from a white listed source.\n   - The article must be about the gadget, not the company, its business practices, or delivery dates etc.\n   - The submitter must not be affiliated with the campaign, company or website\n\n4. No direct image links.\n\n5. Describe the gadget in your post title. No sensationalized, misleading or non-descriptive titles. \n\n6. Articles must about a single gadget, listicles are not allowed.\n\n7. Keep discussions civil and respectful. Know your [reddiquette!](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette). Comments should be on-topic and contribute to the conversation.\n\n8. No Adult Material.\n\n9. English only.\n\n10. If you need advice about a gadget you should ask in the advice [superthread](http://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/about/sticky?num-1). However we highly recommend you also look [at the list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/related_subreddits) since you are more likely to find an answer in a specialized subreddit. \n\n11. Support original sources. Avoid blogs/websites that rehost content without giving credit. Exact copies are never allowed, as are copies that are just slightly rewritten versions of original articles. \n\n12. Follow the [reddit site-wide rules](http://reddit.com/rules).\n\n### Moderation Policy\n\n## We use the [reddit FAQ guidelines for spam](http://www.reddit.com/help/faq#Whatconstitutesspam) when removing spam posts. Additionally, we use a [whitelist system](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/domainlist).\n\n## **If your submission does not appear in the new tab** - it may have been caught by the spam filter. [Message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fgadgets), and we will look at it.\n\n\n#### Filter by category:\n\nsome|header|header|header\n:---|:---|:---|:---\n[](http://xa.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xa)|[](http://xc.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xc)|[](http://xo.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xo)|[](http://xj.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xj)\n[](http://xd.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xd)|[](http://xe.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xe)|[](http://xf.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xf)|[](http://xh.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xh)\n[](http://xb.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xb)|[](http://xg.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xg)|[](http://xi.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xi)|[](http://xk.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xk)\n[](http://xl.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xl)|[](http://xm.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xm)|[](http://xn.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xn)|[](http://xp.reddit.com/r/gadgets/#xp)\n\n\n### Other subreddits\n\n## [The BIG list of related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/gadgets/wiki/related_subreddits)\n\n\n##### Pro Tip: Computers can get viruses.
