Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.\n2. Submissions must be *future focused*.

Images/gifs require a starter comment.\n4. No spamming - this includes polls and surveys\n5. Bots require moderator permission to operate\n6. Comments must be on topic, contribute to the discussion and be of sufficient length.

Avoid posting content that is a duplicate of content posted within the last 7 days.\n10. Submissions with **[in-depth]** in the title have stricter post length and quality guidelines\n11.

Future(s) Studies (colloquially called \"future(s)\" by many of the field's practitioners) is an interdisciplinary field that seeks to hypothesize the possible, probable, preferable, or alternative future(s). \n\nOne of the fundamental assumptions in future(s) studies is that the future is plural rather than singular, that is, that it consists of alternative future(s) of varying degrees of likelihood but that it is impossible in principle to say with certainty which one will occur. \n\n#####Recommended Links\n\n* **[Best of 2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/abk1xr/best_of_2018_vote_on_your_favorite_posts_of_the/)**\n\n* **[Best of 2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/7v87u2/best_of_2017_some_of_the_top_futurology_posts/)**\n\n* **[Best of 2016](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/6g4ztt/best_of_2016_winners/)**\n\n* **[Best of 2015](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/48b5oc/best_of_2015_winners/)**\n\n* **[Best of 2014](http://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/search?q=flair%3Abestof&restrict_sr=on&sort=relevance&t=all)**\n\n\n* [/r/Collapse vs /r/Futurology Debate](https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/5ocxj9/rcollapse_vs_rfuturology_debate_does_human/)  \n\n* [The r/Futurology Wiki](/r/Futurology/wiki/)\n\n* [Futurist Blogs, Sites, and Resources](http://goo.gl/wJSULw)\n\n* [Futurist Reading List](http://goo.gl/jzYvZ9)\n\n* [Futurology Moderator's Forum](/r/FuturologyModerators)\n\n* [Removed Content Archive](/r/futurologyremovals)\n\n* [Tips on how to find content to submit](/r/Futurology/comments/84m56h/tips_on_how_to_find_content_to_submit_to/)\n\n* [Multi-Reddit of the SFTNetwork]\n(http://www.reddit.com/user/xenophon1/m/futurist)\n\n#####Related Subreddits\n\n**For a list of related subreddits, hover over top menu.**\n\n[popular discussions today](http://goo.gl/1q7oUp)\n\n[transparency](http://goo.gl/C0vOBH)\n\n[AMAs](/r/Futurology/wiki/ama)\n\n[domain blacklist](http://goo.gl/zDwI3D)\n\n[IRC](http://goo.gl/Nt9IIa)\n\n[glossary of terms](/r/Futurology/wiki/glossary#wiki)\n\n[source quality](/r/futurology/wiki/sourcequality#quality)\n\n>#\n\n>* [Universe](http://goo.gl/tzkaH6)\n* [Space Settlement](/r/Space_Settlement)\n* [Space Flight](/r/SpaceFlight)\n* [Cosmology](/r/Cosmology)\n* [Space Videos](/r/Spacevideos)\n* [AskTechnology](/r/AskTechnology)\n* [Scifi](/r/Scifi)\n* [Space](/r/space)\n\n\n>#\n\n>* [Transhuman](http://goo.gl/vFWcxv)\n* [**Transhuman**](/r/Transhuman)\n* [Transhumanism](/r/Transhumanism)\n* [Nootropics](/r/Nootropics)\n* [Cyberpunk](/r/Cyberpunk)\n* [Longevity](/r/longevity)\n\n>#\n\n>* [Futurology](http://goo.gl/pr7rJp)\n* [**Futurology**](/r/Futurology)\n* [FuturePorn](/r/FuturePorn)\n* [Retro Futurism](/r/RetroFuturism)\n* [Automate](/r/Automate)\n* [Simulate](/r/Simulate)\n* [TheVenusProject](/r/TheVenusProject)\n* [Basic Income](/r/BasicIncome)\n* [Futurist Party](/r/FuturistParty)\n\n>#\n\n>* [Singularity](http://goo.gl/P3nvU5)\n* [**Singularity**](/r/Singularity)\n* [Robotics](/r/Robotics)\n* [Artificial](/r/Artificial)\n\n>#\n\n>* [**SFT Network**](/r/SingularityNetwork)\n* [FAQ](http://intelligence.org/ie-faq/)\n* [Browse All](http://www.reddit.com/user/xenophon1/m/futurist)\n* [Follow on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/SFTNet/list)\n* [Join us on IRC](http://cbe005.chat.mibbit.com/?server=irc.snoonet.org&nick=nickname%3F%3F%3F&channel=%23singularitynetwork)\n\n[](#heads)\n\n[](https://discord.gg/9C9d9PZ)\n\n[Chat with us on Discord!](https://www.discord.gg/9C9d9PZ)\n\n[](#AMApromo)\n\n[](#AMAtext)\n\n[Apply to be a Mod here!](/r/futurology/wiki/moderator)", "rules": {"rules": [{"kind": "all", "description": "Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.", "short_name": "Rule 1 - Respect", "violation_reason": "Rule 1 - Respect", "created_utc": 1652993382, "priority": 0, "description_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.</p>\n</div><!-- SC_ON -->"}, {"kind": "link", "description": "Submissions must be *future focused*.
