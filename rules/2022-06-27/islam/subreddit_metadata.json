Have a look at the **[wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/wiki/index)** as well for resources, FAQs and introductory information.\n\nPlease do not engage with and report any comments or posts that break subreddit or site-wide rules to better help the mod team. Thank you!\n\nNew to Islam? [Here is some good introductory information!](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/1zh1y9/islamic_resources/)\n\n# Rules\n\n**Please have a look at the complete set of rules [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/about/rules/).**\n\n* We do not tolerate trolling, verbal abuse, disrespect, or comments that incite others based on difference of belief, race, ethnicity, etc.\n\n* Submission titles must be somewhat related to the subject matter. Do not title your post \"I have a question\", instead include the subject, for instance \u201cWhat is Hajj?\u201d\n\n* Users who post questions regarding the religion on a specific topic should not have their threads derailed or be proselytized about other beliefs.\n\n* Submissions which have been involved in (or deemed as potentially leading to) any form of brigading will be removed.\n\n* NSFW/NSFL posts are restricted and must be approved by a moderator\n\n* Do not give or imply any rulings. You can refer to and cite other rulings given by scholars.\n\n* Familiarize yourself with the concept of [*Ikhtilaf*]( https://web.archive.org/web/20160724005727/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikhtilaf). \"When there is a scholarly disagreement on a certain issue, it is impermissible to condemn a person who follows a position that is different from one's own. The requirement to command the right and forbid the wrong does not apply when there is Ikhtilaf upon a position.\u201d\n\n* Always phrase your questions and submissions in a polite manner to ensure proper responses. Keep in mind that the tone you use has a direct effect on the quality of the responses you will receive. Posts may be removed at discretion if we feel the content lacks in civility.\n\n* Any posts that are answered by the wiki or searching for previous threads may be removed.\n\nThe Prophet (\ufdfa) said: \"*The most perfect believer in respect of faith is he who is best of them in manners.*\"\n\n# Related Subreddits\n\n* /r/Hijabis - For the modern Muslimah\n\n* /r/Converts - For converts to
