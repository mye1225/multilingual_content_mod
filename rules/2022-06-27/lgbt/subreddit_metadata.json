{"display_name": "lgbt", "title": "r/lgbt: Reddit's home for the LGBTQ+ community", "id": "2qhh7", "subcribers": 921700, "created_utc": 1205487682.0, "description": "#Want Flair?\n\nClick the (edit) button \u21e7 up above!\n\n[](/safe-space)\n\n#### [](#h4-green)\n\n>This subreddit is by and for people who are Gender, Sexual and Romantic Minorities (GSRM), including but by no means limited to LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender) people, and respect for our diversity and experiences is paramount. All are welcome to participate who agree to follow the rules outlined below:\n\n-------------\n\n\n# Rules\n\n---\n\n>###1: Be respectful   \nNo GSRM-Phobic content (i.e: homophobia, bi/panphobia, transphobia, aphobia, as well as racism, serophobia, ableism, or sexism) If you are submitting a post that contains hateful remarks or triggering language, please precede your post's title with [TW]. For example: \"[TW] Title of Post\". Do not try to start an argument for the sake of an argument. Do not make personal attacks.\n\n---\n\n>###2: Must have willingness to learn; no 'you're too sensitive'   \nDemonstrate a willingness to learn. This is a safe space. Anyone can make a mistake and accidentally say something hurtful or triggering. If you find yourself corrected for making this error, please try to learn from it. This is not a place to tell people that they need to reclaim a pejorative so you can use it, that they should laugh at jokes about them, or that they otherwise just \"shouldn't be so sensitive.\" For lightly moderated LGBT-related discussion, we recommend /r/ainbow. \n\n---\n\n>###3: No bait-and-switch posts   \nBait and switch type threads, where the title makes them look like a bigot but the body is supportive, are not allowed on r/lgbt. LGBTQ+ people see enough hate in our lives, without 'Gotcha' bait posts.\n\n---\n\n>###4: No advertisements, spam, or crowdfunders   \nr/lgbt is here for LGBTQ+ people, their lives, their stories, their content. It is not here for advertising or spam. This includes the advertising of crowdfunders, we cannot verify them, so for safety, we do not allow them.\n\n---\n\n>###5: No survey and research requests   \nWe are unable to accommodate Survey and Research requests, posts that fall into this category shall be removed. Repeat posters will be banned. We suggest you post these requests to /r/lgbtstudies.\n\n---\n\n>###6: No promoting hate   \nHaving posted to subreddits with a negative reputation is not necessarily grounds for an automatic ban, but users whose posting history contains bigotry will be met with intense scrutiny.\n\n---\n\n>###7: Broadcasts must follow RPAN Rules   \nAll broadcasts and their chats must abide by the Reddit Broadcasting Content Policy alongside the r/lgbt rules. For more: https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/wiki/rpan\n\n---\n\n>###8: RPAN: Drinking/Marijuana is allowed with moderation.   \nWhilst drinking alcohol or smoking marijuana are not forbidden on stream if you appear to be intoxicated/under the influence, or you are putting yourself or others at risk, your stream will be removed at moderator discretion. If you try to stream again whilst in the same state, we will give you a temporary ban so you have time to sober up.\n\n---\n\n>###9: Don't share hate speech    \nr/lgbt is a safe space, and while we want everyone to be able to seek support and advice, sharing hate speech in any way can cause harm to the community.\n\n---\n\n>###10: Don't direct message individual mods about a moderation issue--use modmail!   \nPlease send [a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Flgbt) to r/lgbt rather than DMing individual moderators. This will allow the whole team to know what is going on so the correct moderator can deal with the issue.\n\n---\n\n>###11: NSFW Content.   \nr/lgbt is meant to be safe for users of all ages. Do not submit content that a reasonable viewer may not want to be seen accessing in public or at the workplace. This includes pornography, sexualized content, graphic violence, or similar. Discussions of sexual topics, including sexual health, are permitted but must be tagged NSFW.\n\n---\n\n>###12: Moderator Discretion.\nUnfortunately, there will always be some things that our rules do not currently or perfectly cover, in those cases we reserve the right to take action and remove anything that we think could potentially cause harm or does not fit within the spirit of the community and the safe space we maintain here, even if it do not fit one of the rules perfectly.\n\n\n-------------\n\n#[Importing Information on Staying Safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/kytz4c/a_reminder_on_staying_safe_online_for_all_our/)\n\n---\n\n#[Report Rule Breaking Content](https://www.reddit.com/report)\n\n---\n\n#[Interested in becoming a Mod?
