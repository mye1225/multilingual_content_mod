There are \"grey area posts\" which the moderator team handles internally. We don't want your boss firing you over some nudity you didn't mean to see.\n\n2. NO GRAPEFRUIT WHATSOEVER . We have strict rules regarding which fruits are suitable in this subreddit. The Citrus fruits suh as:  Oranges, Clementines, Tangerines, Tangelos, Blood Oranges, Cuties, as well as Satsumas are all acceptable.

Be kind, Treat others how you would like to be treated, and post frequently. Comment on others posts and encourage them to be the best shower orangers they can be. This Rule should be number one. We do not tolerate: hate speech, racism, unkindness,  trolls, griefers, DOXing of uses or brigading(not that I think anyone would have an agenda for that)\n\n\n4. If you see a thread or post that would be suitable to link r/showerorange please do. Askreddit posts about \"whats some weird shit you do\" are mostly where we get spikes in our subscription from.
