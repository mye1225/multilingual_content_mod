We allow throwaways and do not remove 'google-able' questions. While your question may have been answered elsewhere, maybe its answer wasn't sufficient, maybe you didn't understand the answer or maybe you are looking for a discussion about the answer. At any rate, your question is welcome here as long as it follows our rules:\n\n**Rule 1 - Be Kind.**\n\n- Consider the human. If you can\u2019t talk to someone with their best interest at heart, do not participate here until you can.\n\n- No advocating violence or harm. Posts or comments about how to harm yourself or others, or advocating violence/harm of any kind, against anyone, are strictly prohibited. See Reddiquitte and site-wide rules for more information.\n\n- No hateful, degrading, malicious, or bigoted speech against any person or group. Violations will face escalating bans, with a 'three strike' policy.\n\n- No question-shaming or personal insults. If you can't think of something kind to say, don\u2019t engage. If you see a question you don\u2019t feel OP should be afraid to ask, or if they\u2019ve asked their question in a way that offends you, don\u2019t insult or shame them. Report rule violations, kindly let them know, downvote, and move on.\n\n**Rule 2 - Be Helpful.**\n\n- Top-level comments must be legitimate attempts to answer the question. Please try to give your best answer, and direct OP to resources to learn more whenever possible. Jokes are permitted in child threads, but must follow our rules.\n\n- Don't argue, de-escalate. If you disagree with someone's answer, ideas, opinions, or sources, feel free to engage in civil conversation. However, if you can\u2019t discuss a topic calmly and kindly---it happens, we all have something that triggers us---do not engage here until you can. If you see an argument beginning, please encourage de-escalation. If it continues, report it, and move on.\n\n- No medical diagnoses. It is, at best, unwise to take medical advice from strangers on the internet, even if they seem knowledgeable. Giving basic first aid advice, directing OP to relevant resources and licensed practitioners, and citing your own experience is permitted. Please be transparent about your sources and credentials, and report violations of this rule to mods.\n\n**Rule 3 - Be Genuine.**\n\n- No soapboxing, trolling, moralising, sealioning, or spamming. Please visit our wiki for more information and examples of what we consider disingenuous content submissions.\n\n- Give OP benefit of the doubt, unless they have proven otherwise. Assume they are asking in good faith; innocent until proven guilty. Please report violations of this rule to mods.\n\n- As an aspect of the ongoing global pandemic, anti-vaccine sentiment, spreading misinformation regarding safety and efficacy, \u201cmasks don\u2019t work\u201d, \u201cit\u2019s just the flu\u201d etc will result in a permanent ban. There are other forums better suited for this sort of discussion, if you cannot keep your *opinions* to yourself regarding this matter as requested, you are unwelcome here.\n\n**Rule 4 - Follow the Rules.**\n\n- Submissions must be in the form of a question. Any other necessary information about your query, like your reasoning and background, should go in the body of your post, not the title. Posts in violation will be removed.\n\n- Flair your post. Flair helps people find your question in the future. It also makes it easier for OPs to search for previous iterations of their question, before they submit.\n\n- Search our sub before posting. Our updated submission guidelines ask that OP search for previous versions of their question in our sub's history, prior to submitting. This is to reduce repeat questions & maintain high-quality answers. \n\n- Feel free to suggest ways we can improve. Feedback is incredibly helpful to us. Please be kind when you write in. We are people like you, doing our best.\n\n- \n\nCheck out [our wiki by clicking here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TooAfraidToAsk/wiki/index) if you need further clarification. \n\nAll opinions are welcome as long as they are presented respectfully and follow the above guidelines. Rules here are kept more relaxed than our sister subs intentionally to allow as close to an organic user experience as possible. Automod uses reports to decide if a submission is removed and these are all reviewed by a mod within 24 hours. Bans are typically last resorts and the mod team maintains a strict open-door policy. Do not hesitate to reach out to us about any questions, concerns and/or comments you have about the sub.\n\n\nLooking for something like us?\nCheck out\n\n/r/outoftheloop \n\n/r/nostupidquestions\n\n/r/DoesAnybodyElse \n\n###Ever read the main rules of reddit?
