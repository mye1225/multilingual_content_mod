Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can *be your own bank*.\n\nIf you are new to Bitcoin, check out [We Use Coins](https://www.weusecoins.com/en/) and [Bitcoin.org](https://www.bitcoin.org/).

Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.\n* News articles that do not contain the word \"Bitcoin\" are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news.\n* Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. This subreddit is exclusive to Bitcoin.\n* Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.\n* No referral links in submissions.\n* No compilations of free Bitcoin sites.\n* Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like \"Buying 100 BTC\" or \"Selling my computer for bitcoins\" do not belong here. /r/Bitcoin is primarily for news and discussion.\n* Please avoid repetition \u2014 /r/bitcoin is a subreddit devoted to new information and discussion about Bitcoin and its ecosystem. New merchants are welcome to announce their services for Bitcoin, but after those have been announced they are no longer news and should not be re-posted.
