His light guides us away from the temptation of John Travolta, and saves us from our bees.\n\nHis known prophets are Stephen King, who controls the mind, and M. Night Shyamalan, whose endings are always unforeseen. Follow their instructions, and you may achieve Mitt Romney, a state of eternal salvation and peace. \n\nHe is a sworn enemy of Xenu and his minion Obama, and fights against the aliens with the help of the FSM, commander of pirates. \n\nThose who follow the faith of Cagenism are usually referred to as Cagenists or Nicolites, although any title that properly professes devotion to Him is permissible. \n\nPraise Cage! May your Mountain Dew be sweet!\n\nThe words, teachings, and histories of the Cage are found in the Hat. Each chapter of this wondrous script is known as a Cat.\n\n* [The Cat of Creation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-2uPpYtf_xSMwuVe7BevUY4kiMvFf4Pf7ErVom2P60/edit)\n\n* [The Cat of the Hive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LaM946pi92KbDQfODVVbbi6bjQlw7iGmSHPjHgen7e8/edit)\n\n* [The Cat of Decay](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KfhJW1Fq6qsOhQoQArIzHs3WJQzwbWAFDe_zXGdJl1U/edit)\n\n* [The Cat of Discovery](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17FfDndFAUAA8qgb4fO9Ycr5XDrXHUiTgy2sIJ-uTHak/)\n\nWe do not wish to impose any earthly restrictions on His followers, but in order to achieve order, reposts are not allowed.
